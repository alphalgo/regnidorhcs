# regnidorhcs

As we all know Schrodinger's cat what means, which represent a thing's uncertainty. On the contrary, regnidorhcs is the reverse of the word schrodinger, that means we need certainty instead of uncertainty for now. But here we only used status flag of the thing to determined the program's direction, in fact this is unfair. So, we'll refactor that to make this program more steady and general-purpose.

## Install

`go get github.com/alphalgo/regnidorhcs`


## TODO

- [x] takedown() cannot exit process directly, need some specific analysis.
- [] Add runtime function to monitor the program status instead of status flag only.
